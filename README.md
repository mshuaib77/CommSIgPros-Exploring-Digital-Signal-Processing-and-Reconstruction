# CommSIgPros Exploring Digital Signal Processing and Reconstruction
 CommSigPros is a digital signal processing project that provides hands-on experience with the foundational techniques used in DSP. It begins with creating and recording various signals, such as voice and sinusoidal waves, and advances to analyzing these signals using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to understand spectral density and the relationships between the Continuous-Time Fourier Transform (CTFT) and DFT, emphasizing the role of the sampling frequency (fâ‚›).  The project offers visualizations to demystify aliasing effects in sampled signals and implements ideal Low-Pass Filters (LPF) in MATLAB for signal reconstruction.
